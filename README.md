# BAL

Berkeley Abstraction Layer: a portable C/C++ wrapper for Berkeley sockets (IPv6 support)

## UPDATE July 2023

SAL is now BAL. There are too many things in computing called SAL, and it's a dude's name. I'm not a huge fan of BAL, but hey, libbal. It could work.

I have been in the mood to revist old projects that I wrote when I was younger, and I'm on to this one now, so I'm going to gussy it up, put a nice red dress on it (and matching lipstick) so that I can feel proud of it. Twenty years have passed since I started on this code, so hopefully it'll be 2 decades better when I'm done with it.

Stay tuned.
